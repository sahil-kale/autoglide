# Glider Model
The glider is assumed to be modeled as a point mass with a fixed kinematic model

## Variable Nomenclature
- $x, y$: Position of the glider in a fixed 2D world frame (m)
- $V$: Airspeed of the glider (m/s)
- $\psi$: Heading angle of the glider (w.r.t. the x-axis) (rad)
- $\phi$: Roll angle of the glider (rad)
- $h$: Altitude of the glider (m)
- $W_x, W_y$: Wind speed in the x and y directions (m/s)

## Function Nomenclature
- $w(x, y)$: Thermal uplift strength at position $(x, y)$ (m/s)
- $s(V, \phi)$: Sink rate of the glider (m/s) â€“ positive defined as downwards. 

### Sink Rate Model
The sink rate $s(V, \phi)$ expresses how much altitude the glider loses based on the airspeed $V$ and the roll angle $\phi$. Usually found from the glider's polar curve. An example from an ASK-21 is given below here ([source](https://www.williamssoaring.com/fleet/ask21b-bm.html)) ![Glider Polar Curves](ask21-polar-450x.jpg).

For simplicity, a quadratic model fitted around the min sink (defined as $s_{min}$, at $V^{\ast}$). $s_0(V)$ is the sink rate at zero roll angle with the current airspeed, and $k_v$ is a tuning parameter that defines how quickly the sink rate increases as the airspeed deviates from $V^{\ast}$.

$$
s_0(V) = s_{min} + k_v (V - V^{\ast})^2
$$
    
See `polar_computation/eval_polar.py` for a script that fits this model to polar curve data from an ASK21.

Finally, this sink rate is adjusted for the roll angle $\phi$ as there is less lift generated when the glider is banked. See the figure below for more details ([source](https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/19030/what-types-of-maneuvers-increase-the-load-factor-on-the-aircraft)). ![Effect of Bank Angle on Glide Ratio](flight_lift_vector.png).  
For the purposes of this model, it's assumed that the sink rate increases proportionally to the load factor ($n = \tfrac{1}{\cos(\phi)}$) to the power of a tunable parameter $\alpha_n$. There's a more complex relationship here, but keeping it simple since I'm not an aerodynamics expert.

$$
s(V, \phi) = s_0(V) \cdot n^{\alpha_n} = s_0(V) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{\cos(\phi)}\right)^{\alpha_n}
$$

## Glider Kinematics Model
### Position Kinematics
$$
\dot{x} = V \cos(\psi) + W_x
$$

$$
\dot{y} = V \sin(\psi) + W_y
$$

### Turning Rate
The turning rate is derived from the coordinated turn equation, assuming it's perfect. See [this article, equation 3](https://www.spinningwing.com/the-helicopter/turns) for more details.

$$
\dot{\psi} = \frac{g}{V} \tan(\phi)
$$

### Altitude Kinematics
$$
\dot{h} = w(x, y) - s(V, \phi)
$$
